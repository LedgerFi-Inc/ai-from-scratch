"""Retrieval: the routing MEASUREMENT, the fail-closed gates, and the native tools.

THE NUMBERS THIS FILE EXISTS FOR, and the first thing to say about them is which
one is load-bearing. Over the 138 real beginner questions in ai/tests/queries.py,
against a FIXTURE index so the routing half needs no database:

                            all 138        HELD OUT (121)     in the map (17)
    router alone            61  44%        45  37%            16
    substring search        71  51%        65  54%             6
    COMPOSED               106  77%        89  74%            17
    router precision        61/64  95%     45/48  94%
    the hard subset          7/12          search 0/12

READ THE HELD-OUT COLUMN. 17 of the 138 are verbatim phrasings in `concepts.py`,
because the map was authored with this fixture visible; on those the map finds
itself (16 of 17) and the substring search gets 6. That subset is not evidence of
anything except internal consistency, and a number that includes it goes UP every
time somebody writes a new phrasing — measuring the author, not the router. So
every floor below is asserted on the 121 the map was NOT written for, and the
in-map subset is counted separately and pinned so it cannot quietly grow.

THE ROUTER ALONE DOES NOT BEAT SUBSTRING COUNTING. 45 against 65 on held-out
questions, and this file asserts that it does not, because the opposite claim was
made here for a while and it was false. What the router is good at is one thing
only: being RIGHT when it speaks (94% precision) and quiet the rest of the time. It
answers 48 of 121 and declines 73.

THE COMPOSITION IS THE VALUE, and it is the strategy the tools actually implement:
route if the map knows the words, else `sin_ruta` + `siguiente: "buscar_en_curso"`.
89 against 65 on held-out questions, +24. Not because the map is a better scorer,
but because 94% precision makes a decline worth handing on rather than guessing at.

BOTH COLUMNS COME FROM THE SAME 138 SENTENCES, and the substring column is
GENERATED rather than typed: `baseline.search_baseline()` runs
scripts/emit-search-baseline.mjs, which calls `buscar_en_curso` over the corpus
api/src/seed.ts defines. The previous version of this file compared against a
hand-typed dict that disagreed with the real scorer on 53 of 138 entries and
claimed 75/138 where the truth is 70 — with a test that only checked the dict
against itself. Every number above is one run of two real scorers over one list.

THE POPULATION IT CANNOT SERVE, kept visible: 23 of the 138 quote the course's own
analogy («es como afinar una guitarra»), answerable only through words that live in
`lessons.analogy`, `muro: de_pago`. This package may not hold them, so the router
declines 20 of the 23 and the search — which reads the paid text, behind Node's
paywall — gets 16. That is the design, not a defect.

AND THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE NOT ABOUT A LESSON AT ALL: 44 real customer messages in
`queries.OFF_TOPIC` (price, invoice, password, dark mode, the weather). The router
used to name a lesson for 18 of them — «cuanto cuesta el curso completo» came back
as lesson 4 at confianza 1.0. It now names a lesson for NONE of them, and names the
public tool that holds the fact (`precio_y_compra`, `soporte`, `ajustes`…) for 31.
That is `intent.py` plus a floor that no longer lets one shared word route.
