"""The service. A minimal, explicit surface.

    GET  /salud                status, active providers, prompt fingerprint
    GET  /ontologia/prompt     the text the model sees            [secret]
    GET  /ontologia/grafo      nodes, edges, deletion order       [secret]
    POST /ontologia/prueba     runs P1..P4 and the violations     [secret]
    POST /agente/turno         one complete conversation          [secret]

Everything but /salud requires the shared secret. The three /ontologia/* routes
hand out the system prompt, the tool catalog and the table names — the map of
this service — and being unreachable from the internet was the only thing that
made publishing them survivable. That is a property of today's compose file, not
of the code, so the code now requires the secret too. /salud stays open because
the container healthcheck calls it with no headers; it reports whether a key is
configured, never a key, a model prompt or a table name.

Authentication: `x-ia-secreto`, shared with Node. It is not user authentication —
the user travels in `sesion`, which is opaque here and resolved by Node. This
service is not published to the internet: only the API calls it.

The ROUTE paths, the header names and the JSON keys below stay as they are: they
are the contract api/src/ia.js and web/src/pages/chat.astro are written against.

        Assistant turns arrive from the caller and Node forwards the browser's
        copy of them verbatim, so a client can write whatever it likes into the
        assistant's mouth. Verifying them is not possible here: the service is
        stateless by design (Node holds the history) and Node does not sign the
        turns it relays, so there is nothing to check a turn against. What is
        possible is refusing the two shapes that read as instructions rather
        than as conversation — a fabricated final assistant turn that answers
        the question before the model does, and a run of consecutive assistant
        turns, which is how a block of invented "rules" gets stapled on. A
        leading assistant turn is allowed on purpose: Node trims history with
        `slice(-MAX_HIST)`, so an honest long conversation legitimately starts
        mid-exchange, and rejecting that would break real chats.

        Why this level is enough: what a forged turn can still reach is only the
        prompt's conversational rules, and nothing load-bearing rests on those.
        Isolation between users is enforced by Node resolving the userId from the
        session and by no tool accepting a person argument (IDENTITY_ARGS,
        checked by `ai-prove-isolation`), never by asking the model nicely.
        The "never reveal a lab solution" rule cannot be turned into an exfil
        either: `labs.solution` is class `jamas`, so it is absent from the prompt
        and from every tool's `returns` — no tool can return it, and a forged
        turn cannot conjure one. And since the loop now dispatches only declared
        tool names, a forged turn cannot widen tool reach. The residual risk is a
        caller talking their own assistant out of its own study rules, inside
        their own session — worth closing cheaply, not worth breaking chat over.
